# Trees

A data structure in which data items are connected using references in a hierarchical manner

## Challenge

Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
- pre order
- in order
- post order
Create a Binary Search Tree class
- Define a method for Add and Contains

## Approach & Efficiency

- O(n) for time and space on binary_tree and binary_search_tree

## API

Binary_tree
- Depth First Traversal, Search method that returns list of values in tree, according to pre_order, in_order, and post_order convention

Binary_search_tree
- adds node in correct place within tree according to binary search tree conventions on add method
- returns boolean if value exists in tree on contain methods
