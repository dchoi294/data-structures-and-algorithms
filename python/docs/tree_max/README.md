## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

use the post_order method to create a list of all the values and used max method to find the max and return it.

***Big O***
Time: O(n) - will take linear depending on the size of list
Space: O(n) - list will grow linearly depending on the number of nodes

## API

pip install pytest
ran tests based on the tests given and all passed
